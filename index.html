<article>

<p class="news-article";>Could there be a possiblity of going back to school for the state of Virginia, even the whole US?
Could students be involved in a superspreader event in the future? Because if so, there would be approximately 40-50% of
an increase of kids COVID-19 cases. We all know that children has fewer chances of catching the virus. Although, elementary school
students has weaker immune systems than middle and high school students. And doctors do approve you to wear masks at this time. But,
China is making fake hand sanitizer (Potentially Harmful), fake masks (doesn't filter air) and more fake and harmful items. And that
could be a problem for schools is getting sanitation and health products. Also, how are we going to get a whole room full of students
to stay 6 feet apart? There are so many problems between this controversial event.
